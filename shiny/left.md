# Introduction

Metagenome assembly results in fragmented incomplete assemblies
Long read technology allows resolving of repetitive regions
Validation of algorithm output is necessary to ensure  genomes are not misassembled

# Methods 

High molecular weight DNA extraction
Oxford Nanopore minION and Illumina NextSeq 550
